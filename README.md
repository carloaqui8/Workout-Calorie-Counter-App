# Workout-Calorie-Counter-App

### UI/UX
Create a good interface with multiple pages. Main ones are workout tracking, weight tracking, calorie tracking, and user data (4). Maybe add a dark mode at the end.

### Workout Tracker
Track reps and sets for each workout. 

### Weight and Calorie Tracker
Keep an ongoing log of weight by notifying the user every morning. Also keep a log of both daily calorie and protein intake. Graph all of these. Store in database.

### Login/User Authentication
Setup a login system to keep data secure between different users. Store in another database.
